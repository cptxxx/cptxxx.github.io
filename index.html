        I have experience in setting up computer networks for commercial
        companies; I'm also skilled in other computer fields such as server
        setup (VPN, DHCP, DNS, file and printer sharing, etc.). I am currently
        working on open source projects for a free internet in Iran and I have
        been honored to be a small member of the great community of Iranian
        digital libertarians.

      <div class="text">
        In programming languages, I mainly use C++ and C#; I am also skilled in
        C and Python. I'm in love with Linux distributions, of course,
        specifically
        <a href="https://parchlinux.ir/" target="_blank">Parch Linux</a>
        (Persian + Arch) and Kali. I also enjoy writing Bash scripts; and I've
        also used MySQL, Docker, and dotNET in some of the projects I've been
        working on.
